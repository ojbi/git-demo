<script language="javascript1.2" src="style.js"></script>

Step 2) Add the below to the <BODY> section of your page, at the VERY end (right above the </BODY> tag). It is very important that the below be added at the end of the document:

<script language="javascript1.2" src="menu.js"></script>

Step 3) Finally, upload all the .js files contained inside this zip into your webpage directory where the menu resides in.

Note: All configurations to this script should be done inside custom.js. Open up the file using any text editor, and change the menu items to your own.
